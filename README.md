My plan for my project is to make a program that allows you to play the card game "Hand and Foot" against other players. 
To do this I will need to be able to make a program that will draw cards and put them into a deck for each player, allow the user to draw or place cards into piles (melds).
The program should calculate the scores automatically, and not permit the users to perform illegal moves. 
I will use files to store the cards.
I will use methods to sort the cards.
I will use arrays for the scores and for storing cards.
I will use conditionals in the sorting methods. (for loops and while loops)
I will use a list for storing piles of cards for ALL players;
I will use a dictionary to let the players look up their individual scores at the end of the game.
I will create an algorithm for sorting cards and scoring.
I will use a variety of data types for cards and in the methods that I use to distribute the cards; (ints for card numbers, strings for card names, doubles for finding averages at the end of the game, bools for telling the player if they are in their hand or foot deck, char for dictionary key).

Check point #2: The main currently creates a random deck of 11 cards, prints it out, and calculates the number of points all those cards are worth.
